            <h3>Project</h3>
            

            <i> <b>TITLE - Digital Outing System Using RFID and Raspberry Pi with MQTT Protocol.</b>

            </i>

            <p>In this project, a model of digitally controlled outing system is presented. The system 
                is an application of the Internet of Things (IOT) which works on RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) technology. 
                The system can replace the traditional way of maintaining the records for the entries of the students or workers 
                in an institution or organization. It's an effort to digitalize the traditional way which is not so much reliable and 
                efficient. This paper presents the design and implementation of a low cost and flexible outing system based on 
                hardware devices like Raspberry Pi, MFRC552 Card Reader and software tools like Django and Python scripts. This 
                paper presents the efficient working of the system</p>
