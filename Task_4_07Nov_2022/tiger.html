            <h3>Bengal Tiger</h3>
            <p> Linnaeus's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Species_description">Scientific description</a>of the tiger was based on descriptions by earlier naturalists such as Conrad Gessner and Ulisse Aldrovandi.[2] Bengal tiger skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London vary from light yellow to reddish yellow with black stripes.</p>

            <h3>Caspian Tiger</h3>


            <p>Illiger's description was not based on a particular specimen, but he only assumed that tigers in the Caspian area differ from those elsewhere.[18] It was later described as having narrow and closely set stripes.[19] The size of its skull did not differ significantly from that of the Bengal tiger.[12] According to genetic analysis, it was closely related to the Siberian tiger.[10] It had been recorded in the wild until the early 1970s and is considered extinct since the late 20th century.</p>

            <h3>Siberian Tiger</h3>

            <p>Temminck's description was based on an unspecified number of tiger skins with long hairs and dense coats that were traded between Korea and Japan. He assumed they originated in the Altai Mountains.[21] The Siberian tiger was later described as having pale coats with few dark brown stripes.</p>

            <h3>South China Tiger</h3>

            <p>Hilzheimer's description was based on five tiger skulls purchased in Hankou, southern China. These skulls differed in the size of teeth and jaw bones by a few cm from skulls of tigers from India.[22] Skins of tigers from southern China in the fur trade were said to be vivid orange in colour with rhombus-like stripes. Because of differences in the shape of skulls, it was long thought to constitute the most ancient variety.[23] It was noted to have a unique mtDNA haplotype.</p>

            <h3>Indochinese Tiger</h3>

            <p>Maz√°k's description was based on 25 specimens in museum collections that were smaller than tigers from India and had smaller skulls.</p>
            <hr>

            <h3>Malayan tiger</h3>
            <p>It was proposed as a distinct subspecies on the basis of mtDNA and micro-satellite sequences that differ from the Indochinese tiger.[25] In pelage colour or skull size, it does not differ significantly from Indochinese tigers.[26] There is no clear geographical barrier between tiger populations in northern Malaysia and southern Thailand.</p>
