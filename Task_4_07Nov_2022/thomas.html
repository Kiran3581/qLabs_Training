<h3><i>Introduction to Algorithms</i></h3>

Yes, I am coauthor of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>, along with <a href="http://supertech.csail.mit.edu/~cel">Charles Leiserson</a>, <a href="http://theory.csail.mit.edu/~rivest">Ron Rivest</a>, and <a
href="http://www.ieor.columbia.edu/~cs2035">Cliff Stein</a>.  For MIT
Press's 50th anniversary, I wrote a post on their blog about <a
href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/blog/1990-introduction-algorithms">the secret to writing a best-selling textbook</a>


Here are answers to a few frequently asked questions about
<i>Introduction to Algorithms</i>:

<dl>
  <dt> <i>Will there be a fourth edition?  If so, when will it be available?</i>

  <dd> The fourth edition was released on 5 April 2022.  The <a
			 href="https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-algorithms-fourth-edition">MIT Press site for the book</a> has links to sites that sell it.

			 <p>

	<dt> <a name="errata"></a><i>Where can I find a list of errata?</i>
	<dd> For the fourth edition, we maintain an <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html">errata page</a> that allows you to list errors by date, by page, or by severity.

        <p>

            <dt> <a name="errata"></a><i>Where can I find a list of errata?</i>
            <dd> For the fourth edition, we maintain an <a href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html">errata page</a> that allows you to list errors by date, by page, or by severity.
        
                     <p>
        
                     For the second and third editions, we maintained an <a
               href="clrs-bugs/bugs-3e.php">errata page</a> that allows you to list errors
               by date, by page, by severity, or by discoverer.  There is even
               an incremental update feature, allowing you to list only the
               errors posted since the last date that you asked about.  We
               stopped logging errors for the third edition in January 2019 so
               that we could focus on preparing the fourth edition.
        
            <dt> <i>How do I report errors?</i>
          <dd> First, please visit the <a
               href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html">errata
               page</a> to verify that the error has not been reported
               already.  Once you have determined that you have found an
               unreported error, send email to <a href="mailto:clrs-bugs@mit.edu">clrs-bugs@mit.edu</a>.  We will respond as quickly as possible, often within a day.


               <p>

                Please use the <a
                href="mailto:clrs-bugs@mit.edu">clrs-bugs@mit.edu</a> address
                <em>only</em> to report errors.  If you have a suggestion or a
                question, please contact me directly at <a
                href="mailto:thc@cs.dartmouth.edu">thc@cs.dartmouth.edu</a>.
                
                <p>
                
     <dt> <i>Do you correct errors?</i>
       <dd> Yes.  Each time a new printing is produced, it contains
          corrections to all errors that have been reported by that time.
          The <a
          href="https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/11599/e4-bugs.html">errata
          page</a> indicates in which printing each error was corrected.
          </p>
   
       <dt> <i>What is the difference between an edition and a printing?</i>
     <dd> Each edition is a major revision of the book.  The first
          edition of <i>Introduction to Algorithms</i> was published in
          1990, the second edition came out in 2001, the third edition
          appeared in 2009, and the fourth edition is from 2022.  A
          printing for a given edition occurs when the publisher needs to
          manufacture more copies.  As the answer to the previous
          question indicates, we have been correcting errors in each
          printing of the second and third editions.  We perturb the
          pagination as little as possible when correcting errors for a
          new printing.  <p>
   
     <dt> <a name="solutions"></a><i>Can I get solutions to exercises and
          problems?</i>       
       <dd> As of the third edition, we are making available solutions for
          a select set of exercises and problems.  They are posted at the
          MIT Press website.
          
          <p>We have also produced an Instructor's Manual, which is available only to instructors who have adopted the book for
          course use.  The manual has lecture notes and solutions to additional exercises and problems, but by no means all of them.(I estimate that writing up solutions to all exercises and problems would take somewhere between 2000 and 3000 pages.)
          You'll need to contact the MIT Press for passwords to access
          the manual site and the files.  (Contact information is at the
          MIT Press website.) You cannot get the passwords from me or
          from any of my coauthors.
