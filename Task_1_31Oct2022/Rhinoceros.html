    <h1>Rhinoceros</h1>
<strong>White Rhinoceros</strong>
<br>

<em>The white rhinos (Ceratotherium simum) are massive creatures with females weighing about 1,600 kg and males weighing around 2,400 kg. The length of the rhinos ranges between 11 feet and 15 feet and the height at the shoulder ranges from 5.9 feet to 6 feet. The white rhinoceros bears two horns on its snout with the front one being larger than the back one. The rhino also possesses a prominent muscular hump that is needed to support the weight of its large head. Though they are named white rhinoceros, the color of these animals ranges from yellowish brown to slate gray. Body hair is sparsely distributed and mainly concentrated in the tail bristles and ear fringes. The distinctive flat, broad mouth of these rhinos is used for grazing.</em>

<strong>Black Rhino</strong>
<br>
<em>Though not truly distinguished by color, the black rhinoceros was named so to distinguish it from the white rhinoceros. An adult black rhinoceros is significantly smaller than the white species and weighs between 850 kg and 1,600 kg. The females are smaller than the males. The rhinos attain a height that ranges between 59 and 69 inches at the shoulder and a length between 11 feet and 13 feet. These rhinos also possess two horns with the front one being longer than the rear one. A third smaller horn might also exist in some individuals. The black rhino has a pointed mouth used to grasp twigs and leaves while feeding.</em>

<strong>Javan Rhinoceros</strong>
<br>
<em>The Javan rhinoceros (Rhinoceros sondaicus) is a type of rhino with only about 60 survivors in the world today in the Indonesian Java Island. The Javan rhinoceros also has a single horn, similar to the Indian rhinoceros. It has a hazy gray colored skin with folds in the back, shoulders, and rump that gives an armored look to the rhino.

<strong>Indian Rhinoceros</strong>
<br>
<em>The greater one-horned rhinoceros or the Indian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) adorns a single 20 cm to 60 cm long horn and is nearly as large as the African white rhinoceros. The Indian rhinoceros has a thick, silver-brown skin that forms huge folds all over the body of the rhino. The shoulders and upper legs of this type of rhino are covered by wart-like bumps and sparse body hair. Males weigh around 2,500 to 3,200 kg, and females weigh about 1,900 kg. Though these rhinos once inhabited extensive range stretching from Pakistan to China, today, these animals have a highly limited range. They are found in some protected areas of India and Nepal. A few pairs of the Indian rhinoceros are also found in the Lal Suhanra National Park in Pakistan. The Kaziranga National Park in Assam, India hosts two-thirds of the Indian rhino population.</em>
