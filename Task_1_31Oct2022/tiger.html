<strong>Bengal Tiger</strong>

<br>
<bold> The <strong>Bengal tiger</strong> Bengal tiger is a population of the <b>Panthera tigris tigris</b>is subspecies.[1] It ranks among the biggest wild cats alive today.[2][3] It is considered to belong to the world's charismatic megafauna.[4]</bold>

    The tiger is estimated to have been present in the Indian subcontinent since the Late Pleistocene, for about 12,000 to 16,500 years.[5][6][7] Today, it is threatened by poaching, loss and fragmentation of habitat, and was estimated at comprising fewer than 2,500 wild individuals by 2011. None of the Tiger Conservation Landscapes within its range is considered large enough to support an effective population of more than 250 adult individuals.[8]</em></br>

<strong>Siberian Tiger</strong>

<br>

<bold>The <strong>Siberian tiger</strong> or Amur tiger is a population of the tiger subspecies Panthera tigris tigris native to the Russian Far East, Northeast China[1] and possibly North Korea.[2] It once ranged throughout the Korean Peninsula, but currently inhabits mainly the Sikhote-Alin mountain region in southwest Primorye Province in the Russian Far East. In 2005, there were 331–393 adult and subadult Siberian tigers in this region, with a breeding adult population of about 250 individuals. The population had been stable for more than a decade because of intensive conservation efforts, but partial surveys conducted after 2005 indicate that the Russian tiger population was declining.[3] An initial census held in 2015 indicated that the Siberian tiger population had increased to 480–540 individuals in the Russian Far East, including 100 cubs.[4][5] This was followed up by a more detailed census which revealed there was a total population of 562 wild Siberian tigers in Russia.[6] As of 2014, about 35 individuals were estimated to range in the international border area between Russia and China.[7]</bold></body></br>

<strong>South China Tiger</strong>


<bold>The <strong>South China tiger</strong> is a population of the Panthera tigris tigris subspecies that is native to southern China.[2] The population mainly inhabited the Fujian, Guangdong, Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. It has been listed as Critically Endangered on the China's Red List of Vertebrates[1] and is possibly extinct in the wild since no wild individual has been recorded since the late 1980s.[3] In the late 1990s, continued survival was considered unlikely because of low prey density, widespread habitat degradation and fragmentation, and other human pressures.[4] In the fur trade, it used to be called Amoy tiger.[5]</bold></br>
