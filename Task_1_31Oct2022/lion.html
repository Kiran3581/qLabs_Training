<h1>Lion</h1>

<strong> West African Lion</strong>

<br>

<br>
<em>leo  is a lion subspecies, which is present in West Africa, northern Central Africa and India.[3] 
    In West and Central Africa it is restricted to fragmented and isolated populations with a declining trajectory.[4][5] It has been referred to as the Northern lion.[6][7][8]P. l. leo is regionally extinct in North Africa, southern Europe, and West Asia. Asia's sole lion population lives in and around Gir National Park, India.[10] The West African lion population is geographically isolated and numbers fewer than 250 mature individuals. It is listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List.[11]</em>

<strong> Asiatic lion</strong>

<br>

<em> <strong>The Asiatic lion</strong> is a population of Panthera leo leo that today survives in the wild only in India.[1] Since the turn of the 20th century, its range has been restricted to Gir National Park and the surrounding areas in the Indian state of Gujarat. Historically, it inhabited much of southwest Asia to northern India.[2]

    The first scientific description of the Asiatic lion was published in 1826 by the Austrian zoologist Johann N. Meyer, who named it Felis leo persicus.[3] On the IUCN Red List, it is listed under its former scientific name Panthera leo persica as Endangered because of its small population size and area of occupancy.[4] Until the 19th century, it occurred in Saudi Arabia,[5][6] eastern Turkey, Iran, Mesopotamia, Pakistan, and from east of the Indus River to Bengal and the Narmada River in Central India.[7]</em>

<strong>Masai Lion</strong>

<br>

<em> <strong>leo melanochaita</strong>  is a lion subspecies in Southern and East Africa.[2] In this part of Africa, lion populations are regionally extinct in Lesotho, Djibouti and Eritrea, and are threatened by loss of habitat and prey base, killing by local people in retaliation for loss of livestock, and in several countries also by trophy hunting.[3] Since the turn of the 21st century, lion populations in intensively managed protected areas in Botswana, Namibia, South Africa and Zimbabwe have increased, but declined in East African range countries.[4] In 2005, a Lion Conservation Strategy was developed for East and Southern Africa.[5]</em>

<strong>Barbari Lion</strong>

<br>

<em><strong> Barbary lion</strong>also called the North African lion,[1] Berber lion, Atlas lion,[2] and Egyptian lion,[3] is an extinct population of the lion subspecies Panthera leo leo. It lived in the mountains and deserts of the Barbary Coast of North Africa, from Morocco to Egypt.[4] It was eradicated following the spread of firearms and bounties for shooting lions.[1] A comprehensive review of hunting and sighting records revealed that small groups of lions may have survived in Algeria until the early 1960s, and in Morocco until the mid-1960s.[4] Today, it is locally extinct in this region.[5]</em>
